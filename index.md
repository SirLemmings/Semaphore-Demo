### Literature
The fundamental problems of decentralized social networks are counterintuitive. This short writeup explains the mistakes in other projects, like email, and how Semaphore is different:

Semaphore is the first decentralized blockchain without a cryptocurrency, which enables a protocol that functions without fees while also handling spam & personal moderation. This short writeup explains how building such a system is possible and what functionality the Semaphore design enables:

How does Semaphore compare to alternatives?

Need a TL;DR? This short writeup is a very gentle introduction to the problems of centralized social networks and how Semaphore solves those issues:

Need the opposite of a TL;DR? This not-so-short whitepaper has the technical details:
