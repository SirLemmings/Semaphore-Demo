Welcome!
### First App
Blabber is the first app running on Semaphore with (hopefully) many more to come. Make an account! Send a Bleep! Visit <a href="https://blabber.social" target="_blank">blabber.social</a> today. It is a simple demo, but is running on the live Semaphore network. 

### Literature
The fundamental problems of decentralized social networks are counterintuitive. This short writeup explains the mistakes in other projects, like email, and how Semaphore is different:

Semaphore is the first decentralized blockchain without a cryptocurrency, which enables a protocol that functions without fees while also handling spam & personal moderation. This short writeup explains how building such a system is possible and what functionality the Semaphore design enables:

How does Semaphore compare to alternatives?

Need a TL;DR? This short writeup is a very gentle introduction to the problems of centralized social networks and how Semaphore solves those issues:

Need the opposite of a TL;DR? This not-so-short whitepaper has the technical details:
