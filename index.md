If you want to try the software for yourself, run this <a href="https://github.com/SirLemmings/Semaphore/raw/gh-pages/Semaphore.zip" target="_blank"> version</a> and follow the READ-ME instructions to test it out. We are working on a demo version that will create a local network of 5 nodes on your computer, to be released in a few days. Beware of bugs!
